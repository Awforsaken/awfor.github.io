                              W4 is a collaborative ongoing WordPress dev side-project between me(doing designs, logo and such) and awesome developer <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/chriswalkeruk/" target="_blank">Chris Walker</a>(making things work, and helping me with front end after I break it).
                              </p>
                              <p>The idea of W4 was born because of constant requests by friends to design and build them websites... So we had a look at what kind of web agencies there are around and all that and most of them looks like they were designed in the last millennia. So we decided to turn it into its own project, create our own website studio and by doing that expand our skills.</p>
                               </div>
                               
                    <div class="mdl-cell mdl-cell--6-col">

                            <p>
                             While my design skills are fairly strong I really wanted to get more into not actually building front end. That's why we decided to start from scratch and build our own WP site, not by some themes. we started from 0. This desition added a fair amount of work but we are learning so much in return. 
                             </p>
                             <p>
                                So far we have mapped and built entire structure of the site(but not styled it yet *sad face*). Built and styled a responsive mobile friendly header designed logo. 
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                As both of us work full-time and sometimes do entire social life thing, this project hasn't been going very quickly, yet slowly but steadily we move forwards.

                            This is an amazing branding exercise as we have to fill shoes of both: a very needy client and web studio. As a brand, we are still developing as we go but now we have a strong direction to head on.
                            </p>
                        </div>

                             <p>
                                Logo design process was tricky too as we had no clue what we want to call our studio, so while bouncing random ideas around we decided on W4 as in WWWW, first three W stands for world wide web and meaning of the last W is something only we know.
                                </p>

                            <p>
                           We started with paper and pencil and eventually, we ended up with 4 lines adding up to form letter W we liked the idea so we started exploring it. From that point we tried to make W into helix, did bunch of absolutely random colour variations moved stuff around but in the end we decided to incorporate square around W... because squares have 4 corners but that looked very blocky and dull so that's how we ended up with actually both W made out of 4 shapes and 4 as a part of square... in a sense we turned W4 into W4^4. We decided to make it monochromatic as flat logos were taking over the world at the time.

                             As we kinda needed a random copy to fill Chris wrote up this amazing piece of copy and to this day I think that this is probably the best description I have seen in a long time... so painfully honest. In case you can't be asked with reading text on image here it is:'
                             </p>
                             <small>We're cool guys, honest. We make websites, cook pizza and grow chillies. When we're not doing these things though, we mostly work for other companies, selling our labour for the profit of the rich in order to buy food, housing and more, which in turn simply gives our earned currency back to the rich. It's an endless cycle of profit for the corporate giants, and a prison in which every man, woman and child of the working class will forever be stuck.</small>
