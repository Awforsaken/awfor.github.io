                              As one of the key members of the team, I am responsible for doing entire life cycle of updates from rough idea to wireframes to functioning are prototypes to analyzing impact changes caused. I am also responsible for building most of our A/B tests. Due chaotic nature of the business I quite often end up wearing many different hats.

                              <p>Since there is a lot of my projects currently in works I am limited with what I can share. On top of that digging up old screenshots is absolute pain :(</p>

                               We currently are in the golden age of A/B testing where you can go and test pretty much everything, from minor changes such as a colour of the button to entire page tests. A/B testing is a crucial part of my role, and my task is to identify potential areas for improvement, prioritize, build and analyze test. On top of that, I manage bigger picture roadmap and communicate with other areas of the business to identify where we can improve. It also helps that I am proficient in using HTML, CSS and somewhat able to deal with JS.

                            <p>
                             Category page rework was more of a heavy overhaul than a complete rework, take whatever stuff which works improve it and slap it back in. Idea was to refresh category page, make it less daunting ant brighter as the brand generally started moving away from heavy dark shapes into more upbeat minimal and clean territory. 
                             </p>
                             <p>
                                 Did some work on filters too as before we had so many dropdowns within dropdowns and tried to limit this to there it is absolutely necessary, did a general clean up on entire filter section too, made it more structured and easier to use.
                             </p>

                            On top of making category pages look way more neat I've added additional functionality to view more products(6 items per row only displaying picture and a price as names at PLT are absolutely meaningless, instead of 4 items with names) at once, for those with rapid browsing needs and added option to hide/show filters(to maximise space for product images and reduce distractions for those who dont use filters) so that each customer is able to have exactly browsing experience they want.

                            The desktop header was another part I was very keen on changing as it was a fairly blunt copy of boohoo.com header and completely lacked personality while being quite messy. We decided to move away from thick black lines and blocky promo boxes to a more modern lightweight look of full-width banners with a minimalistic header as part of these changes we also added search suggestions.
                            </p>
                            <P>
                                As part of these changes, we also added search suggestions styled in clean minimal way containing both category and product suggestions.
                            </P>

                               The product page is a key area of any eCommerce site and PrettyLittleThing is no different. When I started working here one of my biggest frustrations was how unbalanced and all over the place product page was. It was functional and worked but it was just plain out messy. Things such as a wishlist and share buttons were in fairly illogical place, images were small while there was a lot of free screen-space around. Catwalk video button had poor performance and pretty much year after catwalk video function was released it still had an arrow pointing at it saying it's new.  </p>
                               <p>For a good couple of months, we tested various things on a product page and ended up with a fairly strong list of ideas of what we should do moving towards with new product page. </p>
                               <p>After updated page was released we continued testing it and kept on improving it.</p>
                               <P>For non-gif comparison of the two look at these:</p>

                            While going full width with header we also followed up with full home page rework These days pretty much everything is full width.  Idea was to make home page looking more modern and make our brand imagery "pop" out more.  Added cleaner CTA's and a strip for bloggers/promoters/fashion social stuff.
